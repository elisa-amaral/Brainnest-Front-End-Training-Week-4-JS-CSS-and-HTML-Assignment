# Brainnest Frontend Training Week 4: JavaScript + CSS + HTML Assignment

This project is the Week 4 Assignment of the Brainnest Frontend Training. I've created a calculator that runs the four basic  mathematical operations: add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

The calculator works in chained operations of two numbers, that is, if the user inputs **x + y รท** (firstNumber, operator, secondNumber, operator), the calculator displays **(x + y)รท** as the result, and the user can continue inputting numbers and calling the operators as an equal sign that initiates the next chained operation displaying the result followed by last operator called. The calculator also has keyboard support, both for computers with and without a numpad.
